Airbnb Property Management Optimization
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings aimed at optimizing rental strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue for property owners. The project leverages Airbnbâ€™s dataset to provide insights on pricing, demand trends, and customer preferences, with results visualized through a Tableau dashboard for actionable decision-making.

Problem Statement
As a Data Analyst at Airbnb, the objective of this project is to generate valuable insights from Airbnb's dataset, helping both Airbnb and property hosts improve decision-making through optimized rental strategies, enhanced customer satisfaction, and increased host revenue.

Analysis Goals
Prepare Tableau Calculations and Analysis for the Following:

Neighborhood Popularity and Pricing: Identify high-demand areas and analyze how pricing varies across different locations.
Property Type Distribution: Examine the demand for various property types (e.g., entire homes, private rooms).
Customer Satisfaction and Ratings: Analyze the relationship between listing prices and review ratings to uncover factors driving customer satisfaction.
Seasonality and Booking Trends: Track booking trends throughout the year to identify seasonal demand patterns.
Host and Listing Analysis: Determine which hosts have the most listings and compare their pricing strategies.

What is the price distribution across different neighborhoods?
How does the availability of different room types vary by neighborhood?
